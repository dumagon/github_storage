                              The Java SortedSet interface represents an ordered collection of objects.
                              
                               Thus, the elements in the SortedSet can be iterated in the sorted order.
                               
                               The java TreeSet implements the Red-Black logic . Thus Nodes in TreeSet object 
                               have a boolean field that can be either true(BLACK) or false(RED) 
                               
                               "                                                        "
                               
                                                         [BLACK]
                                                       /         \ 
                                                   [RED]          [RED] 
                                                  /    \          /    \
                                               [black] [black] [black] [black]  
                                              /     \   /   \    /  \    /  \
                                            N       N   N    N  N    N  N    N
                                            
                                            
                                            RB tree requirements :
                                            
                                            Each node is either red or black.
                                            
                                     The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted.
                                     
                                  Since the root can always be changed from red to black,
                           but not necessarily vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis.
                           
                                           All leaves (NIL) are black.
                                           
                             If a node is red, then both its children are black.
                             
                  Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes through the same number of black nodes.
